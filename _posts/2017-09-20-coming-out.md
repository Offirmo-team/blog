So at work, we had this talk again...

* I hereby admit that I'm indenting my personal code with **tabs** (but of course aligning with **spaces**).
  * **Yes** I know that [Developers Who Use Spaces Make More Money Than Those Who Use Tabs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/) but I don't believe there is a causality.
* I furthermore admit that I'm configuring my editor to have tabs take **3 spaces** because 2 is too small and 4 is too big
* And I find snake_case more readable and I'm using it, even when JavaScript is all CamelCase

I must now have lost all credibility 🤣

But obviously, at work, I use spaces 👨🏻‍💼.

The dev community is very religious in its own way...
