attempt 1
web / C++ with xxx
new tech / small community / bugs


attempt 2
web / JS with Angular + famo.us, early flux with baobab
UI is fun
Slowed by UI
Slowed by i18n
Slowed by server complexity: setup + management
Slowed by persistence
app cache
data validation with json schema = useless !
too much code sharing (multi-apps)
Angular OK since I was an expert


attempt 3
node / TypeScript with DI, Redux
CLI based UI
CLI UI not that simple (still wanted i18n)
no UI = no fun
too much configurability
DI too complicated
Redux too complicated
slowed by typescript not ready
code splitting inadequate (by models)
broken tests = where do I start ?
problem with serializing the PRNG
premature features


attempt 4
node / Typescript 2 splitted with lerna
manageable complexity with code splitted by composable state
UI = emojis !



rewrites = good !!!
types = good
