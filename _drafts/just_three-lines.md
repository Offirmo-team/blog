What I did?

- found the place to modify
- found a README on the way, read it to learn
- since it's a common task, documented it in the "howto" guide
- on the way, documented the similar procedure for the last project I worked on
- realised the event was badly named -> renamed it
- realised there was a special attribute in case of error
- proceeded to check if it was correctly handled in other analytics whitelistings
