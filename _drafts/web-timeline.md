5 years ago it was pretty decent: 
We had linters JShint (2011)/ JSLint (2012)   
Node exists (2009)   
Bower was there (before the NPM area) (2012)   
RequireJS with r.js could make multiple bundles with something like a common chunks.   
Less/Sass   
Angular was created in 2010   
React was created in 2013   
JSON format was already more popular than XML   


But the best change was Grunt/Gulp â†’ . Webpack
