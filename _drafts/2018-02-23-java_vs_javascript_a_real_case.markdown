I think so
The problem that most languages are going to have when compiling to WASM is that they are not designed for the web at all
I was talking to the Rust WASM team the other day about code splitting and they said that they are going to have to revisit the language design in order to consider it better
Plenty of other languages are going to face the hurdle of their runtimes and std libs are very heavy when compiled to WASM
Even more languages will face the hurdle that they fundamentally aren't good for building UIs

For languages like TypeScript and Flow, they are going to face a number of challenges:
There is no making JavaScript "sound" or "complete", not without changing the language dramatically.
JavaScript doesn't lend itself well to be AOT compiled to a format like WASM
