I started publishing npm modules again.

I'm a senior fullstack dev

My modules:
- works for me
- are made mainly for my needs
- follow semver
- are protected by 2-factor being enabled on my npm account (login + publish)
- super lean
- tested for bundle size (size-limit)
- striving for isomorphism
- TypeScript
- CJS + ESM
- perfectly declared, compatible with webpack, rollup, node...
- striving for lowest dependencies
- have a CHANGELOG

Modules so far:
